# steps performed

The following steps were performed on the dataset:

1. **Data Cleaning and Missing Value Handling:**
   - Handled any missing values present in the dataset.
   - Analyzed the structure of the data to better understand the fields and their types.
   - Merged rows based on the provided hint, particularly focusing on `trip_uuid`.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extracted features from `Destination Name` by splitting into city, place code, and state.
   - Extracted features from `Source Name` by splitting into city, place code, and state.
   - Extracted time-based features like month, year, and day from the `Trip_creation_time` field.

3. **In-depth Analysis and Additional Feature Creation:**
   - Created a new feature by calculating the time taken between `od_start_time` and `od_end_time`.
   - Dropped the original columns if necessary, based on the feature creation.
   - Compared the difference between the newly created time feature and `start_scan_to_end_scan`. Conducted hypothesis testing and visual analysis to check for significant differences.

4. **Hypothesis Testing and Visual Analysis:**
   - Conducted hypothesis testing and visual analysis between:
     - Aggregated `actual_time` values and aggregated `OSRM time` values (after merging rows based on `trip_uuid`).
     - Aggregated `actual_time` values and aggregated `segment actual time` values.
     - Aggregated `OSRM distance` values and aggregated `segment OSRM distance` values.
     - Aggregated `OSRM time` values and aggregated `segment OSRM time` values.

5. **Outlier Detection and Handling:**
   - Detected outliers in the numerical variables using visual analysis techniques.
   - Handled the outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to minimize their impact on analysis.

6. **Encoding and Scaling:**
   - Performed one-hot encoding for categorical variables like `route_type` to convert them into numerical form.
   - Normalized/Standardized numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler for better model performance.

# Business Recommendations/Insights

1. **Comparison of `actual_time` and `osrm_time`:**
   - **Violin Plot:** Distributions show similar central tendency and spread, indicating predicted times generally align with actual times, though variability and outliers exist.
   - **Scatter Plot:** Positive correlation observed, with notable variability at lower time values.
   - **Bland-Altman Plot:** Differences between the two are centered around zero, indicating no systematic bias, but some outliers exist.

2. **Comparison of `actual_time` and `segment_actual_time_sum`:**
   - **Violin Plot:** Both distributions are centered around zero, showing similar spread but slightly different shapes.
   - **Scatter Plot:** Positive correlation noted, with significant variability at lower time values.
   - **Bland-Altman Plot:** Differences mostly centered around zero, indicating no radical systematic bias.

3. **Comparison of `osrm_distance` and `segment_osrm_distance_sum`:**
   - **Violin Plot:** Similar central tendency, but osrm_distance shows varied peakedness, suggesting a reliable difference.
   - **Scatter Plot:** Positive correlation present, with variability at lower distance values.
   - **Bland-Altman Plot:** Differences are centered around zero, indicating no radical systematic bias.

4. **Comparison of `osrm_time` and `segment_osrm_time_sum`:**
   - **Violin Plot:** Both distributions are centered around zero, with slightly different shapes.
   - **Scatter Plot:** Positive correlation with significant variability at lower time values.
   - **Bland-Altman Plot:** Differences centered around zero, indicating no radical systematic bias.

5. **Wilcoxon Tests:** 
   - P-values indicate no major differences in means for most combinations, except for `osrm_distance` and `segment_osrm_distance_sum`, which shows a reliable difference, though not below the alpha level of 0.05
